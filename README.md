##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- GitHub Personal Access Token (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/maaz404/Devinsight.git
cd Devinsight

# Backend setup
cd server
npm install

# Frontend setup
cd ../client
npm install

# Environment configuration
# Create server/.env with:
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri_here (optional)
PORT=5000

# Start application
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server && npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client && npm run dev
```

Access at: `http://localhost:5173`

##  Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React 18, Vite, Ant Design, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas  
**APIs:** GitHub REST API, npm Registry
**Containerization:** Docker, Docker compose
**Reverse Proxy:** Nginx

## üöÄ Docker & NGINX Integration

This fork adds Docker containerization and an NGINX reverse proxy for production-ready deployment.

### üì¶ How to Run with Docker

1. Build and start containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
    Access the app:

        Frontend: http://localhost:3000

        Backend: Exposed internally to NGINX, no direct local access.

‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Browser] -->|HTTP Requests| B[NGINX]
    B -->|Static Files| C[React App]
    B -->|API Calls| D[Backend Server]
    D -->|Database Queries| E[MongoDB]
    E -->|Data| D
    D -->|Data| B
    C -->|Data| B
```
    Browser ‚Üí NGINX ‚Üí Backend
    NGINX handles static React files at / and proxies API calls at /api/* to the backend service.

Benefits of this architecture:
- **Scalability**: Each component can be scaled independently.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between frontend, backend, and database.

Benefits of using nginx reverse proxy:
- **Performance**: NGINX serves static files efficiently, reducing load on the backend.
- **Security**: NGINX can handle SSL termination and protect backend services from exposing them publically.

### Issues Resolved while containerization and nginx config
1) Nginx can't forward the proxy to backend
STEPS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE:
--> Checked the logs of server container
```bash
docker compose logs server
```
--> Executing the curl request to backend inside the nginx container by exec it in interactive environment in shell  
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id_of_client> sh
curl http://server:5000/api/analyze/test
```
--> Sending the fake request to backend from local frontend served using nginx
--> Check the logs of client container
```bash
docker compose logs client
```
--> Noticed the relative path error nginx was trying to forward the request on http://server:5000/analyze which is incorrect path.
--> Change the proxy_pass in nginx config to use /api/analyze

2) server can't establish connection with mongodb
--> checked the mongodb_uri (used the service name instead of hardcoded ip)
--> Server was trying to connect to devinsight database which is not the database in which admin credential were stored.
--> changed the mongo db uri to use query 'authsource=admin'

##  API Usage

**POST** `/api/analyze`

```json
{
  "repoUrl": "https://github.com/username/repository"
}
```

Returns comprehensive analysis with scores for README quality, dependency health, code quality, and GitHub metrics.

##  Getting Zero Scores?

If your **GitHub Metrics** or **Code Quality** scores show 0:

1. **Add GitHub Token**: Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env`
2. **Get Token**: [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) ‚Üí Generate new token ‚Üí Copy
3. **Update .env**: Replace `your_actual_token_here` with your token
4. **Restart**: `npm start` in server directory

See [GITHUB_TOKEN_SETUP.md](GITHUB_TOKEN_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.
